## App Name

Calendar by Form\*

## Short Description (80 chars)

A private, decentralized calendar powered by Nostr. Your schedule, your keys.

## Full Description

Your calendar is one of the most personal things you own — it knows where you'll be, who you'll meet, and what you're doing every hour of every day. Why hand that to a corporation?

Calendar by Form\* is a fully decentralized calendar app built on the Nostr protocol. There are no accounts to create, no servers storing your data, and no company reading your schedule. You sign in with your Nostr keys, and your events are stored across relays that you choose.

TRULY PRIVATE EVENTS
Most "private" calendar apps just hide events behind a login. Calendar by Form\* goes further — private events are end-to-end encrypted using NIP-59 Gift Wrap, a three-layer encryption scheme where not even the relays that store your events can read them. Each participant receives their own encrypted copy. This level of privacy is unique to Nostr and simply isn't possible with traditional calendar services.

EVERYTHING YOU EXPECT FROM A CALENDAR

- Day, Week, and Month views with smooth swipe navigation
- Create public or private events with rich Markdown descriptions
- Invite participants by their Nostr public key
- Recurring events: daily, weekly, weekdays, monthly, quarterly, yearly
- Add locations, images, and categories to events

WORKS WITH YOUR NOSTR IDENTITY
Sign in with your preferred method — browser extensions, remote signers and bunkers, or Android signer apps like Amber. Your existing Nostr identity works seamlessly.

OPEN SOURCE
Calendar by Form\* is free, open source, and MIT licensed. Inspect the code, contribute, or run your own instance.
