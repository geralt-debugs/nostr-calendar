description: Your calendar is one of the most personal things you own — it knows where you'll be, who you'll meet, and what you're doing every hour of every day. Why hand that to a corporation? Calendar by Form* is a fully decentralized calendar app built on the Nostr protocol. You sign in with your Nostr keys, and your events are stored across relays that you choose.
summary: A private, decentralized calendar powered by Nostr. Your schedule, your keys.
